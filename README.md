# **Competitive Programs**

Welcome to the **Competitive Programs** repository! This repository contains Java projects that focus on implementing complex logic and problem-solving skills. Each project showcases the use of advanced Java features, including:

- **Java 8 Features**: Lambda expressions, Streams API, and functional interfaces.
- **Java Collections**: Efficient data structures such as `List`, `Set`, `Map`, and their implementations.
- **Generics**: Ensuring type safety and reusable code.
- **Exception Handling**: Robust error-handling mechanisms.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

The repository is ideal for developers looking to enhance their Java programming skills and understand advanced concepts through real-world problem-solving scenarios.

## **Projects Overview**

### **1. Car Service Management**  
This project simulates a car service management system, implementing complex logic to manage customer requests, service types, and billing.  
**Features:**
- Use of `strings` to store customer data and services.
- Exception handling to manage invalid inputs or service errors.  

---

### **2. Employee Tax Calculator**  
This project calculates income tax for employees based on various salary brackets and deductions.  
**Features:**
- use of strings to store tax of each person.
- Lambda expressions to calculate tax percentages efficiently.
- Custom exceptions for invalid salary entries.
